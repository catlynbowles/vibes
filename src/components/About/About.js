            I created this application with the intention of incorporating my
            values into my work as a developer. Even though the internet is
            sometimes a place we go in solace to zone out from our emotions, I
            have always wanted to create a tool to help people feel less alone
            in that space. This idea was inspired by a very interesting and
            unique API called the We Feel Fine API. It appears this API is not
            currently being maintained, at least not since 2013/2014 based on
            the data I'm able to retrieve, but the API works by pulling
            information from tweets, and allows queries to connect to emotions,
            pictures and sentences. (Check it out{" "}
            <a href="http://wefeelfine.org/api.html">here</a> if you'd like to
            learn more!)

            I encountered various issues while building, including some CORS
            problems and had quite a bit of troubleshooting while learning to
            work with xml for the first time, since that is what the API
            initially returns. But it's been really fun to build and I hope I am
            able to work with more data like this in the future. Please enjoy!
            And feel free to contact me at catlynbowles@gmail.com with any
            comments, questions, or feedback. XO
