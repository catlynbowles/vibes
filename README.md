### Introduction
This is an application to match a user's feeling with images and pictures scraped from the We Feel Fine API.

### Features
- Displays seven primary emotions for the user to select.
- User can select their current emotional state and view pictures posted from others feeling the same way. On hover, the tweet matched with the picture will be displayed.
- A user can select 'Refresh' to view more emotions. 
- User can close detail window and go back to the landing page. 

### Future Features
- Add playlists recommended to user based on emotional selection.
- Find colors associated with each emotion to display upon selection.
- Each time a user selects an emotion, post to another api to keep track of current selections happening on the site. 

### Reflection
This project was migrated from a React app to Next.js, which came with it's share of challenges. Because of my determination to work with this API, I also learned how to work with xml for the first time, worked through a CORS error using a proxy server, and had a lot of fun playing with the data and colors!
